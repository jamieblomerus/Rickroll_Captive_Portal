## Description
This portal is meant for people who want to make people aware of the risks of using public wifis. And at the same time pranking them with a rickroll.

#### _My study shows that most people prefer being rickrolled over getting their identity stolen._ For more info read the full study [here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ).

Simply use it as any other portal and feel satisfied that you're rickrolling people and making the world a better place.
